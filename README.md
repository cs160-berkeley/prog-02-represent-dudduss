# PROG 02: Represent!

Eagle Eye allows users to find and learn about congressmen in any zipcode/district in the United States using both the watch and the phone. Users can also see the voting results in 2012 in any zipcode/district they want to. Shaking the watch will randomize the results on the phone and watch.
